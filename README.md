# From Pretrain to Pain: Adversarial Vulnerability of Video Foundation Models Without Task Knowledge

This repository contains the official code for our paper **"From Pretrain to Pain: Adversarial Vulnerability of Video Foundation Models Without Task Knowledge"**. We investigate the adversarial vulnerability of large-scale video foundation models (VFMs) under a task-agnostic threat model. Our approach does not rely on downstream task labels or architectures, and directly perturbs the input video to manipulate intermediate representations of pretrained models.

## Overview

The codebase provides a framework to evaluate adversarial attacks on video foundation models across three representative downstream benchmarks:

- **TAD (Temporal Action Detection):** Evaluates the temporal robustness of VFMs under attacks using pretrained VideoMAE-base backbones as visual encoders. 
  
- **MVBench:** A diverse suite of video understanding tasks covering action reasoning, object dynamics, and temporal ordering. Attacks are trained on frozen VFMs (LanguageBind, QFormer, SigLIP), with predictions made via LLaVA-NeXT, Video-LLaVA, and Video-chat2.
  
- **SEEDBench:** A multimodal benchmark involving vision-language tasks such as video question answering and captioning. 

## Structure

The repository is modular, with code organized for:

- **Attack implementation:** Task-agnostic loss functions and optimization routines that operate without requiring task-specific ground truth.
- **Model wrappers:** Interface code for loading and extracting intermediate features from state-of-the-art VFMs, including VideoMAE for TAD.
- **Dataset support:** Preprocessing, dataloaders, and evaluation scripts tailored for TAD.
- **Experiment scripts:** Configurable pipelines for perturbation training and evaluation. Under the `tad/configs` dictionary, `thumos_videomae_b` is used for training and the others used for evaluation.

## Key Features

- Plug-and-play loss formulations that generalize across tasks.
- Compatible with popular attack method (I-FGSM, MI-FGSM, DI-FGSM,...).
- Emphasis on feature-level manipulation.
